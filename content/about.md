Hello! I'm a data scientist at WSP, specializing in analyzing and visualizing large datasets, creating analysis pipelines, applying statistics to discover insights, and producing informative data products to communicate findings. As a member of the Data Informatics Group, I work on data-focused projects that require modern data science tools to solve, helping clients make sense of their existing data or gather new data for them amd extract meaningful and actionable insights.

I am constantly curious about the world around me and strive to continuously ask questions, further my knowledge, and improve my data science skills. Ethical data governance is extremely important to me, and I believe in the principles of stewardship, transparency, integrity, and accountability.

My educational background includes a master's degree in Transportation Technology and Policy from the Institute for Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis. During my time there, I studied transportation policy and focused on new mobility solutions as well as applied statistics, including machine learning and data analysis. Prior to pursuing my master's, I worked as a mechanical engineer at Virgin Hyperloop One (VH1).


Some of my interests: 
Transportation 
New Mobility Solutions 
Applied Statistics
Bayesian Statistics (YAY uncertainty!) 
Mapping/Maps/GIS
Client-Side Visualizations
