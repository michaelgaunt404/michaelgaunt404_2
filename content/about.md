Hello! I'm Mike and I'm passionate data scientist with a deep love for the R programming language. My work primarily revolves around the transportation field, where I specialize in analyzing extensive datasets, handling modeling tasks, and leveraging GIS technology. My journey into mapping began in my early years, and I'm delighted to be applying my expertise professionally.

I really enjoy contributing to projects that require innovative data science solutions. I excel in constructing robust analysis pipelines, unearthing valuable insights through advanced statistics, and delivering data-driven solutions to our clients.

My academic journey includes achieving a master's degree in Transportation Technology and Policy from the Institute for Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis. During my academic pursuits, I explored transportation policy, delving into emerging mobility solutions and mastering advanced statistical techniques, such as machine learning and data analysis. Before embarking on my data science journey, I worked as a mechanical engineer at Virgin Hyperloop One (VH1).

My areas of professional interest encompass:

+ Transportation
+ Modeling Tasks
+ GIS and Mapping
+ Advanced Statistics, including Bayesian Methods (uncertainty!)
+ Data Visualization

The purpose of this blog is to showcase some of the work I've accomplished using R and to assist others in learning R and tackling data science tasks.
