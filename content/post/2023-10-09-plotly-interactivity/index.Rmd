# Unleashing Interactivity with Plotly in R: From Napping to Mapping

## Introduction
- Start with a relocatable anecdote about the importance of data visualization and how "napping" (we all need a break, right?) is relevant in this context.
- Introduce the concept of data visualization in R and briefly mention the two main packages: ggplot2 and Plotly.
  - Make a fun comparison: ggplot2 is like your classic pen-and-paper map, while Plotly is like having a magic wand that brings your maps to life with JavaScript.

## The Power of JavaScript in Plotly
- Explain why Plotly is a game-changer by bringing JavaScript into the mix.
- Emphasize the magic of JavaScript for adding interactivity and reactivity to plots that would otherwise be static.
  - Talk about how JavaScript allows your plots to respond to user interactions, like zooming, hovering, and clicking.
  
# Unleashing Interactivity with Plotly in R: From Napping to Mapping

## Introduction
I'm thrilled about creating visualizations in R üìä; it's one of my favorite starting points when diving into a new dataset. But here's the catch: as my analysis unfolds, I end up with a staggering number of plots... and things can get overwhelming. üôà This plot overload is usually driven by:

- Data and plot hoarding, thanks to a bit of FOMO (fear of missing out).
- Tracking my analysis journey through a trail of plots.
- Trying out different combinations of variables.
- Tweaking specific variables and plotting them again and again.

In my quest for a solution, I discovered that interactive plots hold the key. They allow you to swiftly explore various variable combinations, which significantly reduces the number of plots you have to code. ü™Ñ

However, creating interactive plots can be a bit tricky and sometimes limits your options for sharing your work. In my experience, achieving interactivity often meant diving into Shiny app development, complete with server-side processing. üè¢

Enter Plotly‚Äîa game-changer that elegantly tackles these challenges. It goes far beyond what `plotly::ggplotly()` can do and doesn't demand a server-side setup. üöÄ

In the rest of this blog post, I'll guide you through the art of crafting and deploying interactive client-side plots that liberate you from the world of Shiny dashboards and applications. üåê

Now, let's take a sneak peek at our destination. Below is a Plotly-generated plot with a dropdown filter‚Äîa feature that typically requires a server:

## Required Libraries and Data
- **Libraries**: Before we embark on our journey, make sure you have the following R libraries installed:
  - `ggplot2`: For traditional data visualization.
  - `plotly`: Our magical wand for creating interactive visualizations.
  - `reactable`: For combining with Plotly.
  - `leaflet`: For creating interactive maps.
  - `crosstalk`: For cross-widget communication.
  
```{r}
require()
```

- **Data**: We'll use a sample dataset containing geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) for our interactive mapping examples.

## Static vs. Dynamic: Why Boring Plots Just Won't Cut It

### Static Plots: The Boring Dilemma
- Let's face it, static plots from ggplot2 can be a bit, well, dull. ü•±
- While they serve their purpose for basic data visualization, they often fall short when it comes to making your data truly come alive.
- Static plots may lack the pizzazz needed to explore your data thoroughly.
- They're like a still image from a movie‚Äîinformative but missing the action.

### Limitations of Static Plots
- What's the big deal about interactivity anyway? It's all about the details.
- Static plots may lose valuable information by not offering features like point pop-ups, hover effects, and dynamic filtering.
- When you're working in R and RMarkdown, your HTML documents have the potential for a lot of interactivity. By sticking to static plots, you're leaving a treasure trove of capabilities untapped.

### Unleash the Power of Interactive Plots
- This is where Plotly swoops in to save the day. ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Plotly doesn't just present your data; it lets you experience it. You can zoom, hover, click, and filter your way through your visualizations.
- Get ready to uncover hidden insights, spot trends, and engage with your data like never before.

Now that we've made our case for interactivity, let's dive into the world of Plotly and see how it transforms your data exploration.

  
```{r}
require(ggplot2)
require(plotly)
require(reactable)
require(leaflet)
require(leaflet)
require(crosstalk)
```

  
- **Data**: We'll use a sample dataset containing geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) for our interactive mapping examples.

```{r}

```





## Traditional vs. Magical: ggplot2 vs. Plotly
- Show a traditional way of plotting using ggplot2.
  - Share a code snippet to create a simple static plot.
- Now, let's spice it up! Introduce Plotly and create a similar plot but with interactive elements.
  - Compare the two outputs and highlight how Plotly takes your visualizations to the next level.

## Deep Dive into Plotly
- Let's roll up our sleeves and explore Plotly's capabilities more deeply.
- Discuss various inputs and customization options.
  - Cover basics like scatter plots, line charts, and bar charts.
  - Mention that we won't dive into every plot type (leave some excitement for readers).

## Extending the Magic: Advanced Plotly
### Part 1: Time Series Filtering and More
- Share tips on extending Plotly's functionality using built-in features.
- Explore time series filtering using Plotly's interactive elements.
- Discuss the power of Plotly buttons for dynamic control.
  
### Part 2: Combining Plotly with Other Wizards
- Talk about combining Plotly with other R packages.
- Showcase how to use Plotly with packages like `reactable` and `leaflet`.
- Highlight the Crosstalk package, which enables cross-widget communication and filtering.
  - Explain how it enhances interactivity without the need for a full-fledged Shiny framework.

## Wrapping It Up: Your Map Is Ready!
- Summarize the journey from napping to mapping with Plotly.
- Encourage readers to continue exploring and experimenting with interactive data visualizations.
- Provide additional resources and references for further learning.
