<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>Kara loves to talk about Elon Musk.</p>
<p>A couple of friends asked me how often I thought Kara directly mentions/talks about Elon Musk</p>
<p>This is my attempt to quantify that.</p>

<p>The data used for this was copied directly from the Apple Podcast App website.</p>
<p>I only use show note descriptions so any reference to Elon in a podcast but not in the show notes will not be counted.</p>

<div id="overview" class="section level1">
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Monthly frequency of tech personalities direct mentions in Pivot podcast descriptions.</p>
